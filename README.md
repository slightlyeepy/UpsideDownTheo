# upside down theo

a simple Celeste mod that adds an upside down theo crystal entity.  
**STILL EXPERIMENTAL.**

why not just use gravityhelper, you may ask?  
because it makes the crystal match the gravity of the player, but this one's always upside down.

known issues:
- it has the vanilla quirk of not allowing screen transitions unless you bring that theo crystal into the next room, so you can't leave theo behind. i spent 3 hours trying to fix this and failed send help
- it doesn't move alongside a moving block while standing on top (or, actually, on the bottom) of it, unlike a regular theo crystal

you can grab a zip from the releases page.
