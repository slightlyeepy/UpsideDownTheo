# upside down theo

a simple celeste mod that adds an upside down theo crystal entity.  
**STILL EXPERIMENTAL. CURRENTLY CRASHES ON MACOS.**

you can grab a zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/slightlyeepy/UpsideDownTheo/releases).

why not just use gravityhelper, you may ask?  
because it makes the crystal match the gravity of the player, but this one's always upside down.

# usage

this mod adds two entities:  
- less inconvenient theo
- upside down theo

less inconvenient theo acts like a normal theo, except screen transitions are allowed even if you leave it behind in a room, and it won't auto-remove itself if you enter a room already holding a theo crystal (both of these are things that vanilla theo does).

upside down theo has the behaviour of less inconvenient theo as well as being, well, upside down.

i'd highly recommend using less inconvenient theo instead of regular theo if you plan on having both theo types in your map.

# other stuff

known issues:  
- it doesn't move alongside a moving block while standing on top (or, actually, on the bottom) of it, unlike a regular theo crystal

todo:  
- **fix macos crash**
- make it reskinnable from loenn altho it should already be reskinnable from sprites.xml (changing the normal theo crystal sprite will affect this one too)
